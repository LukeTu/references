We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de.

Our experiments show large improvements over existing methods.

When it comes to texts, one of the most  common representations is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words models have  two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering  of the words and they also ignore semantics of  the words. For example, "powerful," "strong"  and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper,  we propose an unsupervised algorithm that learns  vector representations of sentences and text documents. This algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict  words in the document. Its construction gives our  algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that our technique outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for  text representations. Finally, we achieve new  state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

   abstract = {In den vergangenen beiden Dekaden sind wissenschaftliche, politische und öffentliche Diskurse Gegenstand sozialwissenschaftlicher Analyse geworden. Jedoch zeichnete sich bereits Ende der sechziger Jahre ein zunehmendes Interesse an der Rolle von Sprache, Symbolsystemen und diskursiven Praktiken bei der Erklärung sozialer Tatbestände ab.2 Inzwischen hat sich in diesem Feld der sozialwissenschaftlichen Forschung der schillernde Begriff der Diskursanalyse etabliert, der auf die Bemühungen verweist, die theoretischen, methodologischen und methodischen Probleme bei der Analyse von Diskursen zu reflektieren (Keller 1997). Bei der Produktion, Rezeption und Interpretation von Sinn im Rahmen von Diskursen spielt die Bedeutung von Zeichen, Zeichenrelationen und komplexeren symbolischen Systemen (etwa Mythen, Erzählungen, Ideologien oder Weltbildern) und ihrer Struktur eine zentrale Rolle. Diskursanalysen widmen sich der Untersuchung der diskursiven Praxis der Konstitution und des Wandels von Bedeutungssystemen. Den meisten Diskursanalysen geht es dabei nicht lediglich um eine möglichst genaue Beschreibung der Inhalte themenspezifischer Diskurse, sondern um die Identifikation derjenigen Regelsysteme, die Diskurse strukturieren. Meine These ist, daß es sich bei Narrationen (der Erzählung oder dem Mythos, um zwei Synonyme für den hier zu behandelnden Sachverhalt zu nennen) um ein zentrales diskursstrukturierendes Regelsystem handelt. Individuelle und kollektive Akteure machen — bewußt oder unbewußt — in der sozialen Praxis Gebrauch von narrativen Schemata3 und verleihen dadurch ihren Weltdeutungen und ihren sozialen Praktiken Kohärenz, Bedeutung und qua Wiederholung eine gewisse Regelmäßigkeit.4 Kurz, ich betrachte den Menschen als Geschichtenerzähler (Fisher 1985). Im folgenden möchte ich zunächst auf den Zusammenhang von Diskurs, Narration und Narrativisierung verweisen (Kap. 2). In Kapitel 3 werden die Eckpunkte einer soziologischen Analyse von Narrationen definiert. Kapitel 4 widmet sich den methodologischen und methodischen Grundlagen der Analyse narrativer Diskurse. Abschließend werden die Grundgedanken des Beitrages zusammengefaßt (Kap. 5).},

The chapter provides the critical scholar with a practical toolbox for discourse/culture analysis. It demonstrates how the two mega-narratives, the Normalization Narrative and the Estrangement Narrative, served for the cultural construction of 'war' and 'peace' in Israeli discourse by assisting in the 'normalization' of war and the 'estrangement' of peace. The chapter provides scholars with practical tools for the application of CCDA, focusing in particular on Critical Narrative Analysis and 'Normalization strategies' vs. 'Estrangement strategies.' It aims to emphasize another dimension of CDA, the cultural dimension, in order to lend more weight to CDA as a multidisciplinary approach.},

They are incorporated as two constraints into a semisupervised learning framework for optimization to produce a globally optimal solution.

   abstract = {Critical discourse analysis (CDA) has proved influential in widening the remit of translation and interpreting studies by encouraging scholars to understand translation as a sociocultural and political act, to pay close attention to its impact, and to explore how and to what extent it contributes to the construction of powerful discourses in society. CDA lends itself particularly well to the examination of the news genre, and its application to the translation of global news in particular has thus attracted the interest of a number of researchers. A related criticism of CDA concerns the selection of discourse samples for analysis and a perceived lack of objectivity. Corpus-based CDA has also been used to study audiovisual translation, for example by Mouka et al., who investigate what they refer to as “racism”-oriented discourse in films through an analysis of register shifts, using a custom-built annotated corpus.},

Significant methods for this include the use of the encyclopaedia’s list-based structure and of different features of page anatomy.

be applied to monolingual corpora of billions of sentences. We are using ten
snapshots of a curated common crawl corpus (Wenzek et al., 2019) totalling 32.7
billion unique sentences. Using one unified approach for 38 languages, we were
able to mine 4.5 billions parallel sentences, out of which 661 million are
aligned with English. 20 language pairs have more then 30 million parallel
sentences, 112 more then 10 million, and most more than one million, including
direct alignments between many European or Asian languages. To evaluate the quality of the mined bitexts, we train NMT systems for most
of the language pairs and evaluate them on TED, WMT and WAT test sets. Using
our mined bitexts only and no human translated parallel data, we achieve a new
state-of-the-art for a single system on the WMT'19 test set for translation
between English and German, Russian and Chinese, as well as German/French. In
particular, our English/German system outperforms the best single one by close
to 4 BLEU points and is almost on pair with best WMT'19 evaluation system which
uses system combination and back-translation. We also achieve excellent results
for distant languages pairs like Russian/Japanese, outperforming the best
submission at the 2019 workshop on Asian Translation (WAT).},

It construes indeterminacy as a metaphysical primitive and contrasts this approach to more familiar (semantic or epistemic) accounts of indeterminacy. It argues that there is no conceptual barrier to understanding indeterminacy along these lines. It then shows how indeterminacy (taken as a metaphysical primitive) can be explicated using familiar modal resources. Using this modal framework as a basis, the chapter develops a logic for metaphysical indeterminacy that is fully classical and bivalent. Developing this logic allows for the evaluation of key issues concerning indeterminacy, including higher-order indeterminacy, the interaction of indeterminacy and possibility, and de re indeterminacy.},

As Kress in Van Dijk (1985: 29) states, "Ideologies find their clearest articulation in language. Hence, a powerful way of examining ideological structure is through the examination oflanguage". Adopting Critical Discourse Analysis with particular emphasis on the framework of Fairclough (1989) and utilizing the notions of SFL by Holliday (1985), the present investigation is an attempt to shed light on the relationship between language and ideology involved in translation in general, and more specifically, to uncover the underlying ideological assumptions invisible in the texts, both source text (ST) and target text (TT), and consequently ascertain whether or not translators’ ideologies are imposed in their translations. The corpus consisted of President Bush speeches during the years 2005 till 2008 aboutthe nuclear program of Iran. The data consist of ST (in English) in the form of a political interviews and TTs in the form of 8 translations in Persian. The obtained results proved the fact that the application of CDA for the analysis of the ST and TT helps the translator to become aware of the genre conventions, social and situational context of the ST and TT, and outlines the formation of power and ideological relations on the text-linguistic level.},

   abstract = {This study examines conceptions of outsiders to the polity, focusing on the lexical items migrant(s), refugee(s), and exile(s) in both internet- and print-based sources. Drawing primarily on a subsection of the Genealogies Internet Corpus consisting of left-wing sources, I argue that left-wing politics is currently caught up in the rhetoric of the right and of mainstream institutions in society, largely reproducing the same discursive patterns even as it sets out to challenge them. Dominant patterns in left-wing Internet sources reveal, for example, that the economic migrant vs. political refugee distinction enforced by mainstream institutions remains largely intact, that the assumption of a “refugee crisis” unfolding in Europe is accepted at face value, and that the left is entangled in the same politics of labeling imposed by the right, reproducing designations such as “undocumented migrants” uncritically. Refugees and migrants, moreover, are represented as victims with no agency, are discussed in legal terms that serve to dehumanize them, and are repeatedly “quantified” as a homogenous and potentially problematic category. Acknowledging the contagious nature of dominant discourses and the difficulty of finding an alternative language with which to argue against established institutional rhetoric, the study further explores historical models that appear more consistent with the values espoused by left-wing politics today. It examines a subcorpus of modern English translations of ancient Greek texts such as Thucydides’ The Peloponnesian War and Herodotus’s Histories to demonstrate the viability of adopting a different conceptualization of refugees and other outsiders to the polity that may be drawn from classical antiquity—and/or from nineteenth- and early twentieth-century receptions of texts originating in classical antiquity—and the possibility of developing an alternative discourse with which to speak about migrants in the present.},

   abstract = {In this article, I question the micro-macro separation in discourse analysis, the separation of personal and institutional discourses. I apply a mostly macroanalytic perspective (critical discourse analysis [CDA]) to inform a predominantly microanalytic perspective (analysis of conversational narratives) and vice versa. In the combination of these two analytic approaches to data analysis, I explore the connections between macro-level power inequities and micro-level interactional positionings, thereby establishing critical narrative analysis (CNA). I examine the focus of CDA on institutional discourses and problematize the definition of power discourses by looking closely at the intertextual recycling of institutional discourses in everyday narratives and at the adoption of everyday narratives in institutional discourses. Ultimately, I propose that CNA unites CDA and narrative analysis in a mutually beneficial partnership that addresses both theoretical and methodological dilemmas in discourse analysis. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Critical discourse analysts are being pulled in two directions. On one side, in the age of validity, inter-rater reliability and evidence-based research, it can seem subversive when researchers ‘tell stories’ (rather than ‘write reports’, ‘produce findings’ or ‘demonstrate effectiveness’). On the other side, public relations departments encourage researchers to use ‘storytelling’ techniques to engage public audiences. In this paper, I draw on social and cultural theory to assume that critical discourse analyses are always already narrative. I propose that we embrace (rather than hide) the storytelling qualities of our research. Using similar strategies for all audiences, we undermine traditional power hierarchies between researchers and ‘the public’. Critical discourse analysis then performs its own critical approach. The paper also explores the potential of adopting a ‘carrier bag theory’ of storytelling (Le Guin) rather than telling ‘hero’ stories and reflects on the epistemological, relational and political work done by storytellers in critical discourse studies.},

Our analyses demonstrate the existence of recurring ideological devices such as reductionism, amoralism, familism, verticalism, normalism, victimism and religious relativism. The results are discussed in light of previous research that examines how discursive strategies and narratives may represent powerful tools for understanding criminal organizations. Family-related discourses, in particular, reveal meanings, values and ideas that contribute to constructing criminal organizations’ internal structure, as well as their relationship with the external world.},

   abstract = {By most accounts, the ﬁ eld of ‘corpus-based approaches to discourse analysis’ 
would seem to have a rather slim bibliography: an informal, small-scale survey 
of opinion that I conducted in March 2005 among several corpus-based 
linguists1 revealed a consensus of opinion that was surprising in its unanimity: 
the experts agreed that very little discourse analytic work had been done by 
corpus linguists2 (even with ‘discourse analysis’ deliberately left vague and 
undeﬁ ned in my survey question). From a complementary perspective, most 
discourse analysts would probably agree that few research studies in their 
ﬁ eld have been based extensively on computerized text databases. One reason 
could be that a lot of discourse analysts focus on spoken language, and there 
are not many corpora of spoken English available (or those that are do not 
meet analysts’ requirements). However, discourse analysis (DA) is certainly 
not exclusively restricted to spoken texts, so there must be other reasons for 
this scarcity of corpus-based discourse studies. One reason, of course, is that 
the ‘corporist’ approach is a relative newcomer to the scene and has yet to 
make its mark. The seeming lack of work in corpus-based discourse analysis 
(henceforth CBDA) is surprising, given Kirk’s (1996) summary, more than 
a decade ago, of the work that had been done up until then. His personal 
comment at that time was that:Corpus linguistics and discourse analysis have been good partners, 
not least because they tend to have come from the same stables, e.g., 
Birmingham, Lund, and Santa Barbara. Exhaustive discourse analysesof entire spoken corpora as well as quantiﬁ ed results would make them 
ever better partners.},

Yet one critic, basically sympathetic (Stubbs 1994), comments on "major unresolved criticisms of its data and theory", while another, much less sympathetic (Widdowson 1995a, b, 1996), argues that CDA involves basic conceptual confusions. Benjamin Lee Whorf posed a still unresolved question: do diverse languages influence the habitual thought of their speakers? CDA shifts this question to different patterns of use within a single language, but it makes no clear claim as to how language use might affect habitual thought. Studies of language use and cognition must be comparative: but CDA provides no systematic comparisons between texts and norms in the language. Also, language and thought can only be related, if one has data and theory pertinent to both: otherwise the theory is circular. The paper discusses, not entirely optimistically, whether CDA can be rescued from circularity. Via brief case studies, it illustrates how individual texts can be studied against an intertextual background of normative data from large historical and contemporary corpora, of the discourse of likely readers of the texts, and a socio-historical analysis of the dissemination and reception of texts.},

Focusing on three different languages (English, Chinese, and Japanese), this research analyses Weibo and Twitter accounts of major embassies and news agencies. We first establish our criterion for quantifying "how much can be said" in a digital text based on the openly available Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the translated subtitles from TED talks. These parallel corpora allow us to determine the number of characters and bits needed to represent the same content in different languages and character encodings. We then derive the amount of information that is actually contained in microblog posts authored by selected accounts on Weibo and Twitter. Our results confirm that languages with larger character sets such as Chinese and Japanese contain more information per character than English, but the actual information content contained within a microblog text varies depending on both the type of organization and the language of the post. We conclude with a discussion on the design implications of microblog text limits for different languages.},

The findings suggest that: (1) translation shifts do exist in the translation of graduation epithets, particularly in the form of zero translation, though the cardinal principle of remaining faithful to the original Chinese political discourse is respected; (2) statistical analysis indicates a significant difference in the variation of attitudes towards China and other countries through translation shifts, and the variations of attitudes are in such a way that attitude towards China becomes less positive while attitude towards other countries less negative in the translation of political discourse from Chinese into English. It is argued that the translation participants’ adherence to the General Strategy of Politeness (Leech, 2014) can partially account for the research findings. It should also be noted that the basis for their adherence, ideologically speaking, is to serve the Self's interests.},

Second, the new methods also bring new opportunities for developing rigorous research designs: (1) the Internet can serve as a platform for online field and survey experiments; (2) in some cases, in particular natural experiments, big data make it easier to conduct causal inference; (3) and using big data, there is potential to make inference with regard to a broader context.},

Two words seem to encapsulate these questions: power and knowledge. I think that, in part, I wrote Madness and Civilisation in the light of these questions. at I wanted to say was this: If one poses the question of the relation between such sciences as theoretical physics or organic chemistry and the political and economic structures of society, is one not in fact asking too complicated a question? Is one not in fact expecting too much from possible explanations? If on the other hand we take a science such as psychiatry, would this problem not in fact be much easier to resolve, both because of psychiatry's much less highly developed epistemological frame, but because psychiatric practice is connected to a whole series of institutions, of immediate economic demands, political ' exigences and social regulations? Thus through a 'dubious' science such as psychiatry would we not be able to see with greater clarity the interrelationships between power and knowledge? I wanted in The Birth of the Clinic to pose this question again, this time in relation to medicine, a science which undoubtedly has a more specific scientific structure than psychiatry itself has, but is still one which is also very closely identified with social structures. There are, it seems to me, three reasons for this. The first is the problem that marxist intellectuals in France had (and in this respect they were playing the role assigned to them by the PCF) which was to be recognized by university institutions and by the Establishment. They were thus forced to ask the same questions as them and address themselves to the same problems and the same areas: &dquo;We have tried to be good marxists, we are not unaware of your preoccupations but we are the only ones who can throw light on your old problems.&dquo; Marxism wanted to be accepted as the means by which the liberal tradition of * First published in L'Arc 70, 1977, ppl6-22.},

Corpus-based research assumes the validity of linguistic forms and structures derived from linguistic theory. The primary goal of research is to analyse the systematic patterns of variation and use for those pre-defined linguistic features. Corpus-driven research is more inductive, so that the linguistic constructs themselves emerge from analysis of a corpus.

   abstract = {This study explores unique differences between China Weibo and the United States (US) Twitter in terms of how users carry out online firestorms. This exploration is carried out through a quantitative content analysis of top trending words and associated top tweets over a six-month period on the social media platforms. Our findings suggest that the threshold for considering online reaction to be an online firestorm is significantly higher in China than in the US. The study also suggests that in carrying out online firestorms, US users are much more apt to use mockery and political or social opinion expression against targets than their Chinese counterparts; they are also more apt to actively mobilize collective actions against such targets. Chinese users rarely target governments or politics, though they actively pick out corporations and media/entertainment-related organizations. In the US, on the other hand, it is in fact the government and politics that users target extensively. What is more common on US Twitter than on China Weibo are online firestorms inflicting reputational damage on the ability-related dimension of a target (i.e., ability online firestorms). And what is more common on China Weibo than on US Twitter are firestorms that inflict damage on the social responsibility or ethics-related dimension of the target (i.e., Social Responsibility online firestorms).},

Only the situational information are valuable for the public and authorities to response to the epidemic. Therefore, it is important to identify such situational information and to understand how it is being propagated on social media, so that appropriate information publishing strategies can be informed for the COVID-19 epidemic. This article sought to fill this gap by harnessing Weibo data and natural language processing techniques to classify the COVID-19-related information into seven types of situational information. We found specific features in predicting the reposted amount of each type of information. The results provide data-driven insights into the information need and public attention.},

We find that the correlation of anger among users is significantly higher than that of joy. While the correlation of sadness is surprisingly low. Moreover, there is a stronger sentiment correlation between a pair of users if they share more interactions. And users with larger number of friends possess more significant sentiment correlation with their neighborhoods.

   abstract = {This article studies censorship and translation in the PRC, focusing on how censorship, as a form of institutional (e.g. government, editorial, publishers’) control of the circulation of information and ideas, regulates the activity of translation in the country. It covers 60-odd years sub-divided into three periods: (1) the founding of the PRC to the Cultural Revolution (1949–1966), during which censorship in the translation and importation of foreign literature largely revealed a former Soviet Union influence; (2) the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), during which ultra-leftist political and ideological censorship was so severe that the translation of anything alien was strictly forbidden; and (3) the period from 1976 to the present day, during which time the country first experienced a gradual loosening of severe restrictions and then a more relaxed position on incoming foreign literature which, however, was accompanied more recently with re-enforced regulations of information circulated on the internet. The purpose of the paper is to explore the underlying factors for translational censorship in China and the factors that may have affected the changing or non-changing character of translational censorship; and, through the case of the PRC, to throw insights on how the study of translational censorship may contribute to our understanding of the cultural politics of translation in a broader context.},

   abstract = {Employing a corpus-based methodology and drawing on critical discourse analysis, this study examines news stories about China published in Newsweek and the Korean translations of these stories in Newsweek Hangukpan, the Korean-language version of Newsweek. In so doing, it aims to identify the manner in which China is constructed in the articles selected to be translated for Newsweek Hangukpan and to examine any discursive shifts in the Korean translations. The corpus for this study consists of two separate sub-corpora, designed and compiled using the same criteria and specifications: one sub-corpus consists of English-language texts published in Newsweek from 2005 to 2015, and the other sub-corpus consists of their corresponding Korean-language translations published in Newsweek Hangukpan during the same period. Since news texts produced outstrip the translations, the selection process is largely inevitable and only certain texts are selected for translation; and the socio-political principles or slants of particular news outlets affect which texts are so selected. In this context, the analysis reveals that Newsweek Hangukpan emphasises issues that are directly related to South Korea by prioritising, translating, and highlighting these materials, among other news available for translation; simultaneously, it distances itself from certain views advanced in the English source text by reconstructing the voice from its own perspective and using subtle linguistic changes whenever an argument cannot be applied to the South Korean context, such as by downgrading the marked voices in the Korean translations.},

   abstract = {The intricate relationship between institution, translation and ideology has always been an area of contention among translation scholars. This study aims to investigate the ideology involved in the translation practice of a Chinese government-affiliated institution — the Foreign Languages Publishing Administration (FLPA). Drawing on Fairclough’s (1995) model of Critical Discourse Analysis, this study examines two series of Chinese political documents translated by the Chinese government-affiliated institution, through comparative analysis with those translated by an individual UK-based translator. Using both comparable and parallel corpora, the analysis reveals three types of shifts regularly made in the institutional translations, namely shifts in interacting with readers, in representing actions, and in identifying participants. In contrast, a rather literal rendition is discovered in the translations by the individual translator. Further analysis of institutional practice shows that these shifts by institutional translators are conducted in accordance with the institution’s ‘Three Principles of Adherence’ for international publicity. This study ultimately argues that the mediation is framed closely within the institution’s ideological purpose of ‘presenting China to the world’.},

With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area, of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.},

Several essential aspects, therefore, are addressed within the scope of this survey. On the one hand, this paper focuses on presenting typical methods from three different perspectives (task-oriented, granularity-oriented, methodology-oriented) in the area of sentiment analysis. Specifically, a large quantity of techniques and methods are categorized and compared. On the other hand, different types of data and advanced tools for research are introduced, as well as their limitations.

@article{Wacquant2008,
   abstract = {This article amplifies Tom Slater's diagnosis of the causes of the gentrification of recent gentrification research. It argues that the shift from the denunciation to the celebration of gentrification, the elision of the displacement of the established residents, and the euphemistic focus on 'social mixing' partake of a broader pattern of invisibility of the working class in the public sphere and social inquiry. This effacing of the proletariat in the city is reinforced by the growing heteronomy of urban research, as the latter becomes more tightly tethered to the concerns of city rulers. Both tendencies, in turn, reveal and abet the shifting role of the state from provider of social support for lower-income populations to supplier of business services and amenities for middle- and upper-class urbanites - among them the cleansing of the built environment and the streets from the physical and human detritus wrought by economic deregulation and welfare retrenchment. To build better models of the changing nexus of class and space in the neoliberal city, we need to relocate gentrification in a broader and sturdier analytic framework by revising class analysis to capture the (de)formation of the postindustrial proletariat, resisting the seductions of the prefabricated problematics of policy, and giving pride of place to the state as producer of sociospatial inequality. © Journal Compilation © 2008 Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Schwartz2013,
   abstract = {This article explores why over the past thirty years political theorists largely failed to address the emergence of neoliberal capitalism and the debilitating effects of growing inequality on the lives of ordinary people and on the nature of democracy. The article argues that the predominant focus of political theory from the 1980s onwards on the role of group identity in political action and on epistemological questions of the nature of the self, while having the positive effect of helping theorists to interrogate forms of domination that cannot be reduced to class, also led many "radical" political theorists to downplay how the macro-structural workings of late capitalism-and the neoliberal erosion of social rights-limit the possibilities for human freedom. The article concludes by arguing that if radical political theory is to inform political practice it must revitalize a theoretical understanding of social solidarity and of democratic equality. © 2013 Copyright Caucus for a New Political Science.},

@article{El2017,
   abstract = {There is little doubt that Edward Said's seminal text Orientalism is still believed to be one of the most important books of its time. Indeed, although a great amount of academic ink has been spilt on the discussion of Said's masterpiece, because of its academic value, there is still a need for more in-depth thinking and research on the book. In this respect, among the aspects of the book which the present paper proposes to explore is the profound influence which the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci has on Said's thought and research. Gramsci, as probably goes without saying, is best known for his concept of cultural hegemony as the predominant mode of rule. For Gramsci, the dominant classes maintain their rule through the use of cultural institutions to establish the consent of the subaltern classes. That is, instead of using force and coercion, the ruling class develops a hegemonic culture through the use of ideology to manipulate other classes into accepting their status as subaltern. Gramsci's elaboration on the concept of cultural hegemony appeals a lot to the author of Orientalism because it allows him to uncover the ideological side of the West's construction of the Orient. That is, following Gramsci's concept of cultural hegemony, Said argues that it is through culture and ideology that the Western powers promote certain ways of thinking which legitimate their invasion of the Orient. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it aims at exploring the main features characterizing Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony. Secondly, it attempts to show how Edward Said reinvests the concept to expose the colonialist ideologies underpinning the Western texts on the Orient.},

   abstract = {Although Gramsci's debt to Croce is well known, most commentators simply accept his criticisms of Croce and his claim to have overcome certain lacunae in the Neapolitan's thought. This article argues that many of these criticisms misfire, and mounts a Crocean critique of Gramsci. Through a comparison of their respective views of historicism, hegemony and intellectuals, it is argued that the radical democratic and libertarian theory many post-Marxists claim to find in the Sardinian is more appropriately associated with Croce. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},
